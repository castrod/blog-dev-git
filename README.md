# Hosting development blogs in GitHub

## The Introito

Finally, I've decided to write a blog focused on software development. Maybe blog is not the proper word, I would rather choose journal. I want a place to 
write down my thinkings on particular subjects I deal daily so my future me remembers clearly the reasons behind the choosen path.

However, I want this place to be a bidirectional channel between its readers (if any, hopefully at least my fuiture me) and myself and I expoect to enrich 
others (if possible) as much as they could enrich me.

Also, been this the first post of the so called blog, it must describe not only the underlying tools choosen for such a task but also the reasons behind them.

Thus, the objective of this first post is to describe the setting choosen and the reasons behind them.

## The Proposal

The tools must be choosen accordingly with the needs behind the problem, in this case I would cosider the following groups of needs:

* economical: first and foremost, it must be cheap, let us say free.

* technical: 

** easy to write and update from everywhere, 

** allow easyly improve on contributions from readers and 

** allow easy distribution of source code and documentation (the actual post).

* engagement: 

** readers should easily follow up updates, new posts and so on

** readers should be able to easily use the proposed solutions, 

** readers should be able to easily propose improvements on posts an underlying source code.
